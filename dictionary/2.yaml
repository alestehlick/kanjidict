  etymology_essay: >
    哀 unites the form of a ceremonial garment (衣) with the ‘sai’ 口-shaped vessel used in 
    rituals to offer prayer texts to the gods. When a person died, a 口 ‘sai’ was placed 
    into the neckband of their robe — a physical marker of grief and a spiritual gesture 
    calling the soul back (tamayobai). Thus, 哀 is not just sorrow as emotion but sorrow 
    as rite — a ritualized grief inscribed in gesture, textile, and utterance. The Shang 
    viewed the boundary between life and death as negotiable: the dead could return, or 
    fail to leave. 哀 captures the moment when the living reach back, hoping to close 
    what remains open. It is pity imbued with rite, and grief embodied in the ceremonial 
    act of recalling the departed soul.

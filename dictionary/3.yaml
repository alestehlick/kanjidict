  etymology_essay: >
    The character 愛 brings together a person pausing to look back (夊 with 心 beneath) — 
    a figure whose heart is reluctant to leave. In Shang cosmology, emotional states were 
    not private but had ritual and communal significance. 愛 depicts not a spontaneous 
    impulse but a measured, solemn yearning: the sorrowful pause before parting, a weighing 
    of the heart. In early rites, this backward glance becomes a sacred moment — a hesitation 
    not just of affection but of connection, as one lingers at the threshold between presence 
    and absence. Thus 愛 evokes both love and grief, as all true love contains the seed of 
    its loss. Its Japanese reading intersects with 悲, suggesting a shared tonal field between 
    ‘love’, ‘sorrow’, and ‘the heart drawn back’.

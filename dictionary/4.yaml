  etymology_essay: >
    The root of 悪 lies in the shape of 亞, the tomb chamber — a site of abomination and 
    taboo for the living. In the world of Shang belief, where the dead required continual 
    ritual attention, such a sealed chamber, if improperly tended, could become a haunt of 
    ghosts and corruption. Thus, the place that once bore ancestral dignity could also fester 
    with spiritual danger. The addition of 心 (heart) and later layers gives us 悪 — a character 
    encoding the feeling of horror and revulsion. It is a sacred fear transmuted into moral 
    judgment. From this abominating dread, the semantic field of 'hate' and 'evil' emerges. 
    悪 is not merely moral disapproval; it is a shudder that rises from the memory of improperly 
    buried spirits, the shadow of unappeased dead pressing back into the world of the living.

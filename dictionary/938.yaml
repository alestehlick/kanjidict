  etymology_essay: >
    縄 combines 糸, the thread radical, with the phonetic and semantic element 韋 (used 
    phonetically here as ‘jō’), but its true significance is knotted into ancient ritual 
    craftsmanship. In Shang and later cultures, cords were not just tools but instruments 
    of law and measurement. The earliest ropes — coarse, hempen lines — became progressively 
    refined into the ink cords (墨縄 *suminawa*) used to draw straight lines on wood or stone, 
    snapped taut to leave an imprint of order. This act of alignment — of imposing straightness 
    upon the chaotic material of the world — birthed not only architecture, but metaphor: 
    from ink cord to rule, from rule to rectification.

    In this way, 縄 came to mean “to measure” and “to correct” — to bring into conformity 
    with a higher standard. Even the etymological sense of 法 (*nori*: law) shares this 
    lineage. To draw a straight line was not only practical — it was cosmological. 
    It aligned the visible world with the invisible lines of Heaven. Thus, 縄 is not 
    merely a rope, but the ritual thread that binds the human to the divine.

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 京 originally depicted the arched entrance or exit of a great fortress gate, as seen in oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions. Above this gate was a lookout or watchtower, emphasizing its imposing structure. Because the capital was defended by such monumental gates, 京 came to mean “capital” (miyako) and also “great, large” (ōkii). In ancient practice, corpses from battlefields were sometimes sealed within the plaster of fortress gates, making them function as curse barriers to ward off malign influences, similar to the role of temple gates (sanmon) in monasteries as protective spiritual thresholds.</p>

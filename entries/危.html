    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 危 depicts the form of a high cliff (厂) with a figure kneeling at its edge, bending forward and looking down. This posture conveys the sense of being in a precarious position, which gave rise to the meanings “dangerous” and “perilous.” The older form shows only the figure on the cliff, while the later form adds a kneeling person element (巳) at the base, emphasizing the human presence in relation to the precipice. By extension, 危 could also mean “high,” reflecting the elevated and risky position of standing at the edge of a height.</p>

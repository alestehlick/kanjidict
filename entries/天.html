    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 天 shows a human form with an unusually large head, and in the oracle bone inscriptions it is drawn with the head emphasized in this way. This suggests a divine being with extraordinary power, rather than an ordinary person. In ancient ritual language, “heaven” did not originally refer to the sky but to this supreme deity with an enlarged head who exercised authority over the world. Later, the meaning extended by association to the vault of the sky above. In bronze inscriptions, the form became simplified into a human figure marked with a line above the head, and in seal script it settled into the familiar form, from which the modern character derives. Thus, 天 fundamentally signifies the supreme god, and only secondarily came to mean “heaven” or “sky.”</p>

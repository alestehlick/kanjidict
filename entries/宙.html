    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 宙 is formed with 宀 (roof, covering) and the phonetic 由. While later texts distinguished 宇 as space and 宙 as time, both originally referred to spatial expanse. The phonetic 由 is likely related to 卣, a vessel modeled after a gourd: when the fruit ripens, its insides turn to oil (油), leaving a hollow shell that becomes a container. By this association, 宙 carries the sense of a hollowed interior, extending metaphorically to the vast empty space beneath the heavenly canopy. Thus 宙 denotes the expanse of the heavens as they arch and cover everything below, the boundless space under heaven.</p>

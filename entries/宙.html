    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shuowen says: ‘The high place inside a boat.’ It is composed of 舟 (boat) and 由. In the *Nan-zi, Tianwen xun* it is written: ‘Existing in the宙, it comes to the present.’ Shuowen also says: ‘宙 means interval.’ Based on this, later dictionaries said 宇 refers to space and 宙 to time, but this is an error of the lexicographers. 宙 means the empty space in the high part inside a boat. Later this meaning was generalized to the space between heaven and earth. Thus 宇 and 宙 together designate the universe: 宇 for spatial extension, 宙 for temporal extension.</p>

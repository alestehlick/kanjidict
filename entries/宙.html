    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 雲 is formed from the rain radical 雨, indicating precipitation, combined with 云, which depicts drifting vapor or breath-like exhalation. In the oracle bone inscriptions the element 云 already represented vapor rising and spreading, and when placed under the canopy of 雨 in the bronze inscriptions, it came to express the phenomenon of vapor thickening in the sky into visible clouds. In ritual texts, such clouds were not merely meteorological but were regarded as manifestations of divine activity, the condensation of heavenly breath through which the gods revealed their presence. From this conception, 雲 was understood as the sacred vapor that gathers and disperses, connecting heaven and earth, and only secondarily as the ordinary clouds seen in the sky.</p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 当 originally conveyed the idea of equivalence or correspondence, “to meet in value,” as expressed in the phrase “fields meeting in equal worth.” Yet before this legal and economic sense, the graph carried a ritual dimension: its use with 尚 indicates service or offering directed to the gods, suggesting that what was “fitting” or “appropriate” was first defined in relation to divine order. In bronze inscriptions, it appears in contexts of pledging or mortgaging fields, but classical texts also preserve its older ritual usage, later broadening to mean what is appropriate, proper, or to be in a position of responsibility.</p>

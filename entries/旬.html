    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 旬 is composed of the elements 勹, depicting something wrapped or enclosing, and 日, the sun. In the earliest script forms, such as the oracle bones and bronze inscriptions, it shows the sun enclosed or passing through its cycle, symbolizing a completed span of days. This form expressed the idea of a recurrent period, in particular the unit of ten days that divided the lunar month in the ancient Chinese calendar. Because this cycle determined the rhythm of life and offerings, 旬 carried ritual significance as a calendrical measure. In later usage, the sense of a defined and proper span of time was extended to seasonal produce, giving rise to the familiar meaning of “the season when something is at its best.” Thus, 旬 originated as a sacred calendrical unit and later broadened into a general marker of timely ripeness.</p>

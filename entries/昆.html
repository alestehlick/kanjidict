    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 昆 depicts an insect, with 比 representing its legs. Since insects often swarm together, the form suggested gatherings or clusters. From this association comes its link to <a class="kanji-link" href="混.html">混</a> (majiru: to mix), which expresses states of mingling and confusion. 昆 was also extended by phonetic loan to mean “brothers” (kyōdai, keitei), as in 昆弟 (kontei: brothers), because of its shared On reading. Additionally, the On reading kon carries the nuance of “small” or “offspring,” as seen in 鯤 (kon), which refers to fish fry or eggs.</p>

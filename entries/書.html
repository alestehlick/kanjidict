    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 書 is formed from 聿, the hand holding a brush, and 者, which originally depicted piled branches placed on a 口-shaped covenant vessel, later covered with earth to form a clay hedge or wall (堵). In ancient practice, talismans and sacred writings were buried in such walls to create a protective barrier. 書 thus first referred to the sacred characters inscribed for ritual purposes. In bronze inscriptions it appears in contexts of bestowing documents of appointment, as in the formula 書受、册命, “to receive the writing and be granted a mandate.” Because of this ritual role, 書史 (shoshi) was the official in charge of sacred records. Over time, 書 came to mean writing more generally—letters, documents, and books—and extended further to signify calligraphy (書道), the refined art of writing according to established styles (書法).</p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 東 was originally the form of a sack (橐, “fukuro”) tied at the top and bottom. While it did not retain the meaning “bag,” it was later borrowed to represent the direction “east” (higashi). The directional characters 東 “east,” 西 “west,” and 南 “south” were originally created through this loan method, taking readings rather than retaining their pictorial meanings. To preserve the older sense of “sack,” the character 橐 (taku) was formed by adding the phonetic 石 (seki), since 宕 (tō) and 拓 (taku) share that marker. Thus, 東 in its current use reflects a borrowed sense as a cardinal direction, while its original form denoted the tied sack. In Japanese it also came to signify the eastern provinces, as in 東歌 (azumauta), the songs and ballads of the people of the East.</p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The earliest form of 气 is a pictograph of streaming clouds, drawn with three layered strokes suggesting drifting vapor. It is essentially the same character as 乞 in origin, with 气 representing the noun form—the vital breath or numinous vapor—and 乞 expressing the verbal sense of supplication or entreaty. In bronze inscriptions we find usages such as “to receive the auspicious mandate by 气,” reflecting the belief that sacred vapor was the object of prayer and invocation. Later, 气 developed into 氣 (and modern 気), but its original image was that of the cloudlike essence rising and descending between heaven and earth.</p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 登 combines 癶, depicting both feet poised as if ready to set out, with 豆, the image of a high-footed vessel. Together they form the picture of mounting a stand or platform, giving the sense of “to ascend, rise, go up.” In oracle-bone and bronze forms, there is also a variant showing 廾, two hands raising up the 豆 vessel, which expresses the act of presenting offerings. From this ritual context, 登 could mean “to make an offering” or “to recommend.” In agricultural usage, as in 登歳, it also came to mean crops bearing fruit, and thus “to ripen, to come to fruition.” From these roots of ritual ascent and harvest abundance, 登 developed its familiar meanings of climbing, rising, appearing, and achieving completion.</p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 私 is formed from 禾, a grain plant such as rice, and ム, which represents a plow. Together they depict the act of cultivating crops with a plow, referring to a farming person tied to household labor. From this sense arose the meaning of belonging to a family group (私属), and by extension the idea of what is personal or private, as opposed to 公, the public realm. Early texts such as the Han Feizi explain this contrast, noting that Cang Jie, when creating writing, used 私 to denote self-centeredness and 公 as its reverse. Thus 公私 came to express the duality of ruler and subject, public and private. In origin, however, 私 reflects the image of the peasant laborer, whose work and status were confined within the private sphere of family and subordination.</p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle bone inscriptions, 空 depicts a building or chamber with a hole or opening, originally signifying a space that has become hollow inside. It conveys the sense of emptiness created when something once present has been removed, leaving a void. In bronze inscriptions the character often appears in connection with storage rooms or houses where provisions had been taken out, and in later forms it came to express the idea of something being unoccupied or vacant. From this original sense of hollowness, the meaning broadened to denote absence, futility, or “nothingness,” and eventually extended further to designate the vast, open expanse of the sky. Thus, 空 is not at first the “sky” itself, but rather the hollowed, empty space that suggested it.</p>

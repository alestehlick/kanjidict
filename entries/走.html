    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The earliest form of 走 is a pictograph of a person running, shown with arms flung forward and legs in motion, with 止 below representing the footprint to emphasize movement. Rather than being a compound of “heaven” and “foot,” as later explanations suggested, the graph as a whole directly depicts the act of running. Thus 走 originally conveyed the vivid image of swift motion and came to mean to run, hasten, or rush.</p>

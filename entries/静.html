    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character 静 is originally written 靜, combining 青 and 爭. 青 refers to the blue-green pigment made from cinnabar, used in antiquity to sanctify ritual vessels. 爭 depicts hands (爪 and 又) grasping a 力-shaped plow, suggesting contention or exertion. 靜 expresses the ritual of purifying and exorcising a plow with blue pigment so that pests would be driven away and abundant harvests secured. This agricultural purification rite was extended in meaning to denote tranquility and ease: a condition where cultivation and harvest proceed smoothly, free of harm. Thus 靜 came to signify “peaceful” (yasuraka) and “quiet” (shizuka). It was also used interchangeably with 靖, especially in contexts of cleansing spaces for rituals, and by extension carried the meaning “to be at ease, to be set in peace.”</p>

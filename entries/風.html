    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The earliest form of 風 was a pictograph of a great bird, imagined as the phoenixlike creature whose beating wings generated the wind. In oracle bone inscriptions, only this bird-shaped graph appears; the later form with 虫 does not occur. Over time, the character was reanalyzed: 虫, originally representing reptilian or dragonlike beings, was added under the influence of the idea that dragons inhabited the heavens, and 凡 was introduced as the phonetic. Thus the original image of wind as the breath of a vast celestial bird was gradually transformed into the later composite form. At its root, however, 風 signifies the vital, moving air stirred by divine creatures of the sky.</p>

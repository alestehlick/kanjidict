    "explanation": "The original form of 会 is 會, depicting a cooking pot or pan with a lid. The top shows the lid, the middle the vessel used for preparing food, and the bottom (日) the stand or base. This image suggested various foods being gathered together in the pot, giving rise to the meaning “to collect, to gather, to meet.” The related character 合 also shows a vessel with a lid, carrying the sense of fitting or joining together. From these images of combining and assembling, 会 came to denote meetings, assemblies, and encounters, extending metaphorically from food being brought together in a pot to people coming together in society."

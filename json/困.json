  "explanation": "The graph shows a piece of wood fitted across an enclosing frame 囗, depicting a bar set on a gate to stop passage. It is the original form for 閂, the specific character for a gate bolt. In Yanzi Chunqiu (Za Shang), the expression 井里の困 refers to the guarded village gate where entry and exit were strictly controlled. From the idea of barring movement and prohibiting passage, 困 came to mean being at an impasse—unable to advance or retreat—and later generalized to “being in difficulty” or “to suffer,” while 閂 was used for the concrete sense of a gate bolt."

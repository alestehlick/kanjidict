    "explanation": "The character 園 is built on the phonetic 袁 (en), which originally depicted funerary rites: a jade placed at the neck of the deceased, the element 之 as a footprint at the pillow, and the image of the dead being sent on the journey to the afterlife. From this base, 園 came to mean the enclosed grove or shrubbery surrounding a burial place. Closely related is 苑, referring to a gently sloping park or pasture, likewise associated with such sacred spaces. 園 thus early carried the sense of graveyard enclosure, as seen in terms like 園塋 (cemetery), 園陵 and 御陵 (imperial mausoleum), and 霊園 (public cemetery). At the same time, by extension from “enclosed grounds,” it also came to denote gardens, orchards, and fields, and in later usage broadly means park, garden, or cultivated plot."

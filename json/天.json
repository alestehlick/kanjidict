    "explanation": "The character 天 originated as a depiction of the crown of the human head, the highest part of the body, and from this sense of “summit” it came to mean the sky, the supreme realm above. It was tied to the idea of authority, as seen in the Shang expression 天邑商 (“Heavenly City Shang”), where 天 functioned as a title of reverence for the supreme deity. In the Zhou, this personal god was reinterpreted as an abstract principle conferring the Mandate of Heaven, and related myths such as the headless deity 形天 and the punishment of 鑿天 (decapitation) reflect its roots in the head-top as the source of life and command."

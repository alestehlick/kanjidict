    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 天 is glossed as “the top, the highest, above which nothing exists,” and is analyzed as following 一 and 大, though the upper element is not actually 一. In oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, the character depicts the crown of a human head, thus originally meaning “summit of the head.” The punishment of decapitation was called 鑿天 (“splitting the head”), and in the Classic of Mountains and Seas (Overseas Western Classic) there appears a deity called 形天, represented as a headless figure, reflecting this association. Because the crown of the head was also linked with the “voice” or “command” of heaven, the character came to signify the sky itself. In Shang usage, the capital was called “Heavenly City Shang” (天邑商, with 商 being Shang’s formal dynastic name), where 天 functioned as a reverential title for the supreme deity. While the Shang worshiped 帝 as a personal god, the Zhou abstracted this notion into a principle, claiming that their royal authority was founded upon receiving the Mandate of Heaven (天命)."

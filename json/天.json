    "explanation": "Contrary to the later analysis “one + great,” the earliest oracle-bone and bronze forms of 天 depict the crown or summit of a human head (巓頂), giving the original sense “top, summit of the head”; this sense underlies expressions like the “鑿天” punishment (beheading) and the Shanhai jing account of the headless deity 形天, both presupposing 天 as the highest point of the head. Its sound value aligns with 巓 (ten), and from “summit” the meaning extended to the dome of the sky. In Shang texts the capital is styled “天邑商,” where 天 functions as an honorific epithet; in the Zhou period the notion was idealized into an impersonal “Heaven” that bestows the Great Mandate, transforming what for the Shang had been the personal supreme deity 帝 into the abstract Tian."

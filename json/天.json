    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 天 is explained as “the highest, above which there is nothing,” and is analyzed as a compound of 一 and 大. However, the upper part is not truly 一. In oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, the character shows the crown of a human head, with 天 originally signifying “the top of the head.” The punishment of decapitation was called 鑿天 (“splitting the head”), and in the Classic of Mountains and Seas a headless deity is described, reflecting this connection. Because the crown of the head was also associated with the “voice” or “command” of heaven, the character took on the meaning of the sky itself. In the Shang period, the capital was called “Heavenly City Shang” (天邑商), with 天 used as a title of reverence for the supreme deity. For the Shang, this was 帝, a personal god; but the Zhou reinterpreted 天 as an abstract principle, claiming that they received the “Mandate of Heaven” (天命) to establish their royal authority."

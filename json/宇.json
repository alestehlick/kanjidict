    "on_readings_romaji": ["u"],
    "category": "heavenly phenomena",
    "meanings": ["eaves of a house", "the heavens", "universe"],
    "explanation": "In early inscriptions, 宇 combines 宀 (a roof) with a phonetic element derived from a curved blade (弯曲する刃器), whose sound and sense carry the idea of something large and broadly arched. This came to signify the great, loose curvature likened to the canopy of the heavens spreading down on all sides. Under this imagery, 宇 denotes not merely a house eave, as later interpretations proposed, but the overarching vault of space itself, a structure vast and sheltering like the heavens."

    "explanation": "Shuowen says: ‘窻 (mado, window) is 空. 空 means to bore through a window.’ 窻 means a hole. 工 means something that bends gently and extends across. Like a rainbow or the color crimson, it is something that bends gently and stretches across. The sky hangs down like a dome, appearing like the dome of heaven, and so it came to be called 空."

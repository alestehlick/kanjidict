    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 宇 is defined as “the eaves of a house,” written with 宀 (“roof”) and the phonetic 于. In the Yijing (Xici Zhuan, lower section) it is said, “The ridgepole is above, the 宇 is below,” distinguishing the upper beam from the spreading eaves beneath. The 籀文 (large seal script) form writes 宇 with 禹, but it is phonetic in origin. The element 于 carries the sense of something large and gently curved, originally derived from the image of a slightly bent blade. 宇 thus came to denote things broadly arched, likened to the way the sky droops down on all four sides. While the Shuowen glosses it as “the eaves,” its imagery extends to the overarching vault of heaven."

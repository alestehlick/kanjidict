    "explanation": "The character 宇 is built on the form of 宀, representing a roof or house, and beneath it is 于, which in this context functions phonetically. In the oracle bone inscriptions it does not yet appear, but by the time of the bronze inscriptions 宇 is used in the sense of a dwelling or the eaves of a building extending outward from the roof. From this architectural image, 宇 came to signify the protective covering of a house, and by extension the overarching expanse of the heavens as a kind of cosmic roof. Thus, 宇 carries the sense of a roof’s sheltering projection, and in later usage broadened to denote the universe or the great vault of heaven itself."

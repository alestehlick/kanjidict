    "explanation": "In Shirakawa’s account, 宇 is “the eaves” under a roof: the graph places 宀 above and borrows the phonetic 于 below, with 于 originally naming a bladed implement whose edge bends gently (a 彎曲する刃器), so its phonetic also carries the sense of something large and softly arched; thus 宇 depicts the broad eaves spreading beneath the ridgepole—“the ridge above, 宇 below” (繋辞伝)—and by analogy names the great canopy of the sky, imagined as drooping on all four sides; in large-seal (籀文) forms 宇 can take 禹 as phonetic (cf. 寓), but the core image remains a roof over the expansive, gently curving span conveyed by the curved-blade phonetic."

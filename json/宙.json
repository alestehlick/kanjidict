    "explanation": "The character 宙 is formed with 宀, the roof radical, combined with 由, which originally depicts a vessel pierced by a ladle or tube, symbolizing the act of drawing something out. In early script forms, 宙 does not appear in oracle bones but is attested in bronze inscriptions, where it designates the space within a house or chamber, particularly the central void beneath the roof. From this sense of an enclosed yet open area, 宙 came to mean the interval or expanse that extends between two points. Over time, its meaning broadened from the limited interior of a dwelling to the boundless span of the heavens and the universe. Thus, 宙 conveys the notion of a suspended, empty expanse, first of a house’s interior, and later of the vast space of heaven and time."

    "explanation": "The character 庭 designates the forecourt within a palace or residence. While 廷 refers to the central open courtyard where ceremonies and official acts were conducted, 庭 depicts that same ritual space provided with a roofed structure (广). Thus 庭 conveys the sense of a formal courtyard or hall for rites and gatherings, distinguished from the uncovered central court."

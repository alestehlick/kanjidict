    "explanation": "The character 廷 refers to the forecourt or open space before a hall. In bronze inscriptions it appears in the phrase 中廷, denoting the central courtyard where ritual acts such as the granting of commands and gifts were performed. The element 夏 here does not mean the Xia dynasty but conveys the idea of the extended, uncovered area outside a building, while the phonetic 玉 provides the sound. The broader form 延, related in structure, shows a person standing erect before the earth deity, expressing the sense of upright presence. Thus 廷 came to signify the court space where formal ceremonies and governance took place."

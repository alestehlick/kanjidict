    "explanation": "The character 早 was originally linked to the form of 匙, “spoon,” representing the bowl portion used for scooping. When a handle was added, it produced the character 是. Because the spoon’s scraping form overlaps graphically with 蚤, the two characters came to be used interchangeably in ancient writing. In early texts such as the Mencius, 蚤 appears with the sense “early,” as in phrases like 蚤起, “to rise early.” Through this association, 早 acquired its established meanings of “early,” “morning,” and by extension “young,” while its original sense related to “spoon” fell away."

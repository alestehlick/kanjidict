    "explanation": "In its earliest form, 旬 did not mean simply “ten days” as later usage fixed it. Oracle bone inscriptions show the coiled tail of a dragon, not the wrapping form that later commentators proposed. This image, closely related to the early form of 雲, suggests that 旬 originally represented a dragon-shaped spirit. In Shang divination records, we find fixed formulas such as “Will there be no misfortune in the next 旬?”, indicating that 旬 was conceived as a specific numinous being who governed periods of time. Only later was the character associated with 日, giving it the sense of a ten-day cycle, but its origin lies in the dragon-spirit presiding over temporal phases."

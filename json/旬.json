    "explanation": "The character 旬 originated as the image of a dragon curling its tail, a form closely related to the ancient script for 雲, which also depicted the dragon as a spirit within the clouds. Later, the element 日 (“sun, day”) was added, and 旬 came to denote the cycle of ten days. In oracle inscriptions, 旬 appears in divinatory formulas that judged the fortune or misfortune of the coming ten-day period, showing that a 旬 was originally conceived as the manifestation of a divine being presiding over each span of time."

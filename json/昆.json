    "meanings": ["insect; descendants; posterity; brothers; offspring"],
    "explanation": "The character 昆 depicts an insect, with 比 representing its legs. Since insects often swarm together, the form suggested gatherings or clusters. From this association comes its link to 混 (majiru: to mix), which expresses states of mingling and confusion. 昆 was also extended by phonetic loan to mean “brothers” (kyōdai, keitei), as in 昆弟 (kontei: brothers), because of its shared On reading. Additionally, the On reading kon carries the nuance of “small” or “offspring,” as seen in 鯤 (kon), which refers to fish fry or eggs."

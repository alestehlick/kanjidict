    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 气 is defined as “the vapor of clouds,” and treated as a pictograph. Although Shuowen does not include the character 乞, 气 was originally the same graph as 乞, later differentiated when 氣 (modern 気) came into use. In bronze inscriptions it appears in expressions such as “to offer up with reverent qi for the good mandate,” showing that spiritual vapor or breath was regarded as an object of prayer. The character itself represents the drifting of three layers of cloud: the first stroke rises at the left, while the third stroke descends to the right, producing the form of 气. If 气 is understood as the noun meaning “vapor” or “breath,” then 乞 may be seen as its verbal counterpart, “to supplicate” or “to implore.”"

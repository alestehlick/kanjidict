    "explanation": "The character 气 originally depicts vapor rising like breath or mist, a form already visible in oracle bone inscriptions where it shows the curling movement of air. It represents an immaterial force, something invisible yet perceptible through its effects, such as breath, wind, or the exhalation of vapor. In early script, 气 often appears in ritual contexts, signifying the vital essence or spirit that animates life, akin to the breath of the living. Later, when combined with 米 (rice), it gave rise to the more complex form 氣, expressing vapor or fragrance arising from food, further linking the idea of breath and nourishment. Over time, the simplified form 气 retained the sense of air, atmosphere, or vital energy, preserving the original concept of rising vapor as the manifestation of life-force."

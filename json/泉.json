    "explanation": "The character 泉 is a pictograph of water flowing down from a cliff, representing a spring of fresh water. As explained in the Shuowen, it signifies water that emerges and becomes a river, hence its meanings “fountainhead,” “spring,” and “spring water.” The character 原 was later formed by adding the cliff radical (厂) to 泉, to specify a source or origin. Because 泉 shared the same On reading sen as 銭 during the time of Wang Mang (1st century CE), 泉 was also borrowed in the context of money, as seen in terms like 貨泉 (kasen, “coinage”), leading to associations between springs as sources and coins as circulating wealth."

    "meanings": ["mix; blend; confuse; chaos; disorder"],
    "explanation": "The character 混 takes its On reading from 昆, which depicts an insect with 比 representing its legs. Because small insects tend to swarm together in confused clusters, the sense of “mixing, blending” (majiru) arose. Thus, 混 expresses states of mixture or confusion, as in 混一 (kon’itsu: fused into one) and 混同 (kondō: mingling, conflation). It is also central in the term 混沌 (konton: chaos), referring to the primordial state before heaven and earth were distinguished, a state without separation or order. The Laozi (Chapter 25) describes this as a primal, undifferentiated existence predating the creation of the cosmos."

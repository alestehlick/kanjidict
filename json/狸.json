    "explanation": "The character 狸 originally referred broadly to small, uncanny animals, and in early usage it could even denote the cat. In some contexts cats were called 狸奴 (rido), since they were thought to be a kind of 狸, alongside the tanuki or raccoon dog. This association came from the mysterious qualities of cats: their pupils that open and contract with the light (giving rise to the phrase 猫の目, “cat’s eyes,” for things that change rapidly) and their link to magical practices. Records mention 猫鬼 (byōki), the use of cats in spells performed on the “day of the rat” in the ancient calendar. Such customs reflect the sense that cats, like the tanuki, carried an eerie, supernatural aura."

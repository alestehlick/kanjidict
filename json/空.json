    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 空 is defined as “an opening below,” written with 穴 (“cavity”) and the phonetic 工. In the preceding entry, 竅 (“aperture”) is explained as “empty,” so that 空 and 竅 gloss one another, both denoting a hole or cavity. The element 工 conveys the idea of something gently arching upward, as seen in characters such as 虹 (rainbow), 杠 (crossbar), and 江 (river), all of which describe things extended in a broad, curved span. 空 thus depicts a hollow that appears dome-shaped, with its sides gently sloping downward, and 工 serves not only as the phonetic element but also as a suitable image of this arching form."

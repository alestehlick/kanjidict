    "explanation": "空 and 竅 are used as reciprocal glosses: 竅 means an opening or orifice, and the graph of 空 follows 穴 (“cavity”) with 工 as its phonetic; moreover, 工 itself conveys the notion of a gently up-curving span laid across—seen in words like 虹 (rainbow), 杠 (crossbar), and 江 (river)—so 空 pictures an orifice whose four sides droop slightly and present a dome-like profile (空竅), with 工 aptly serving both the arching image and the sound."

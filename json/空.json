    "explanation": "The character 空 is formed with 穴 indicating a cavity and 工 suggesting a broad, gently curving span, like a rainbow or arch. Together they depict a dome-like hollow, its sides sloping softly downward, evoking the image of a vaulted opening. From this form it came to signify both an aperture or void and, by extension, the empty expanse of the sky."

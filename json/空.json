    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 空 is defined as “an opening below,” written with 穴 (“cavity”) and the phonetic 工. The preceding entry explains 竅 (“aperture”) as “empty,” and 空 and 竅 thus gloss one another, both signifying a hole or cavity. The element 工 carries the sense of something loosely curved or arching upward, as seen in words like 虹 (rainbow), 杠 (crossbar), and 江 (river), all of which describe things extended in a broad, gently curved form. 空 therefore evokes an arched dome with its sides gently sloping downward, resembling a vaulted opening, with 工 functioning both as sound and as an image of this arching shape."

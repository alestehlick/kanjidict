    "explanation": "The character 線 is written with 糸, the thread radical, and 泉 (sen) as the phonetic. 泉 originally depicted water flowing from the base of a cliff, while 戔, associated with it, conveyed the idea of flat things piled up. From these elements, the character came to mean “thread” or “line.” In classical texts, it denotes sewing thread or strands of fiber, as noted in the Shuowen (“縷, thread”) and the Yupian (“clothes are sewn with it”). Over time, 線 was extended beyond textile use to describe anything long, narrow, and continuous, whether physical (a line, wire, or cord) or abstract (a trajectory, outline, or connection)."

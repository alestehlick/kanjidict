    "id": "U+8D70",
    "kanji": "走",
    "kun_readings_romaji": ["hashiru"],
    "on_readings_romaji": ["sō"],
    "category": "action",
    "meanings": ["to run, dash, flee, hurry"],
    "explanation": "The earliest form of 走 is a pictograph of a person running, shown with arms flung forward and legs in motion, with 止 below representing the footprint to emphasize movement. Rather than being a compound of “heaven” and “foot,” as later explanations suggested, the graph as a whole directly depicts the act of running. Thus 走 originally conveyed the vivid image of swift motion and came to mean to run, hasten, or rush."

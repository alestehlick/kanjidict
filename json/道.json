    "explanation": "The earliest form of 道 shows not merely a path but a ritual act performed upon it. In bronze inscriptions the character depicts a human head carried in the hand (又) while proceeding along the road (辵). This represents the practice of 除道—ritually purifying the way when traveling outward, likely by carrying the severed head of an enemy or outsider to clear and protect the path. Over time, the graphic element 首 remained, but its original ritual sense was forgotten, and 道 came to mean simply the way or road. Later, the concept broadened further to signify a moral path, principle, or cosmic order."

    "meanings": ["snow, snowfall; sometimes to cleanse, wipe away"],
    "explanation": "The earliest form of 雪 is a pictograph showing snowflakes falling beneath the sign of rain. The small shapes beneath the rain radical are not independent characters but depict the flakes themselves, making the whole graph an image of snow descending from the sky. Its primary meaning is thus the natural phenomenon of snowfall. Later associations, such as the idea of “cleansing” or “brushing away,” are secondary extensions connected with words like 刷 or 拭, but they do not reflect the original sense. At its root, 雪 simply represents the vision of snowflakes drifting down from the heavens."

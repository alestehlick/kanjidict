    "explanation": "In the Shuowen jiezi, 雲 is glossed as “the vapor of mountains and rivers,” written with 雨 (“rain”) and explained as resembling a swirling, rotating form, with 云 treated as its base. In early script, the full 雨 element was sometimes omitted, giving the abbreviated ancient forms. Yet the idea that clouds are something that “rotate” likely reflects a later misunderstanding, influenced by these abbreviated forms. The true original graph is 云, depicting two flowing lines of cloud-vapor beneath which is shown the body of a beast bending its lower half. This image signified the belief that within the mass of clouds dwelt a dragon-shaped spirit. The element ム thus represents the dragon with its lower body curved beneath the vaporous lines above."

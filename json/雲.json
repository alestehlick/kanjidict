    "explanation": "The earliest form of 雲 derives from 云, which originally depicted flowing vapors of cloud-breath (雲気). Beneath the parallel lines of drifting vapor appears the form of a beast bending its lower body, signifying the dragonlike numinous being thought to dwell within the clouds. This imagery conveys the ancient belief that clouds were not merely vapor but living, spiritual presences in the sky. Later forms added the 雨 element to emphasize their connection with rainfall, but at its root 雲 expresses the animate, divine substance of cloud-breath and its celestial manifestations."

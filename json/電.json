    "meanings": ["lightning; electricity; electric; sudden, swift"],
    "explanation": "The character 電 is composed of 雨, the rain radical used for atmospheric phenomena, and 申, which originally depicted a flash of lightning. Together they form the image of lightning flashing amid rain. Thus, 電 came to mean “lightning” (inazuma, inabikari) and by extension anything that occurs with sudden, violent swiftness, as in 電撃 (dengeki: lightning attack) or 雷電 (raiden: thunder and lightning). In later usage, the character was extended to denote electricity, as seen in compounds such as 電気 (denki: electricity), 電流 (denryū: electric current), 電信 (denshin: telegraph), 電報 (denpō: telegram), and 発電 (hatsuden: electricity generation)."

    "explanation": "In its earliest forms, 風 shows an image of an insect enclosed within a frame or cave-like shape, representing a creature carried along by moving air. In the oracle bone inscriptions, the character depicts this insect being blown about, and from the bronze inscriptions onward it appears with the enclosing form resembling a house or cavern, emphasizing the idea of something residing in or emerging from it. The character thus expressed the invisible yet powerful movement of air, manifested through what it carries with it. In ritual thought, wind was not merely a natural phenomenon but a numinous force, the breath of heaven that moved across the world, bringing both fertility and destruction. Over time, 風 came to denote not only physical wind but also the figurative “winds” of custom, style, or influence, retaining the original sense of a pervasive and animating force."

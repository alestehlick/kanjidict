    "explanation": "The character 駅 is a simplified form of 驛, whose On reading marker is 睪 (eki). 睪 originally depicted the carcass of an animal, with 皿 showing the eyes and the structure below (幸) representing the limbs. This imagery conveyed the sense of something torn apart, disjointed, or loosened—leading to meanings of “dissolve,” “relax,” or “extend over time.” Related characters like 釋 combined the pictograph of animal claws with this form, signifying the tearing apart of a carcass. From this sense of something spread out or extended, 駅 came to denote “staging posts” (umaya), horse-relay stations along long routes, each linked in succession across distances. In Japanese, the character developed further to mean “station” in general, encompassing rail stations, bus stops, and metro stations."
